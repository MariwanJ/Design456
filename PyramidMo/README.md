# Install using the addon manager
In FREECAD go to the Main Menu/Tools/Addon Manager
- Select the tab Workbenches
- Select 'Pyramids-and-Polyhedrons' and click "Install"


# How to install the workbench manually 
(if not available in FreeCAD-addons)
- Find the Macro folder via FreeCadMenu/Edit/Preferences/Macro ...
- Go to the 'Mod' folder, next to the 'Macro' folder
- download a copy of this repository and put it in the Mod folder
- IMPORTANT! Rename the folder to "Pyramids-and-Polyhedrons" (remove "-master")
- (re)start FreeCAD
- The workbench 'Pyramids-and-Polyhedrons' is now in the list of workbenches.


# Alternative solution
Macro Pyramids and macro Polyhedrons
The addon manager does contain the same functions as macros.
So if you have trouble installing the workbench, this is a suitable alternative.
