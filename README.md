# Design456 Workbench for FreeCAD

Warning!
Work in progress. It is only the begining. 

Note: Please feel free to suggest, contribute, become a member, help, debug, ..etc .. I am new in both Python and FreeCAD python. Originally I program in CPP/C/ Assembly and other languages. 
I hope you find this workbench useful. 

Aim of the pojrect: 
Make a workbench that collect all the good things from FreeCAD and form it in a way that make working with objects as easy as it is in other CAD programes (Like 123D Desgin, TinkerCAD, 3D Wings ..etc)

I will take benifit of all workbenches available already, (not stealing), but reuseing, My start come to life by looking at the template workbench D3D-Printer-Workbench. Thanks for the author.


Note on the current progress: 
-Use Face to extract a face from a side. 
-You cannot use Extrude to Extrude a side .. Use the other icon Copy-Face-Extrude 
-There is a bug in the split .. The "Link" command is not working but as I show it in the video, you can manually fix that.
